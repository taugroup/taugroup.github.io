  <a href='https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/funding-opportunities/past-funding-opportunities/psiap-public-safety-radio-data'>
  Public Safety Innovation Accelerator Program: Public Safety Radio Data Grant</a>. As public safety begins to
  transition from Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems to packet-based broadband systems such as LTE (Long-Term Evolution)
  and 5G technology, shared public safety radio datasets are becoming increasingly important. In the effort to support
  the transition from LMR to LTE, Texas A&M seeks to gather this data from several different public safety
  organizations to develop traffic models and determine overall system requirements."

  image: CI_food4thought.png
  description: "The US Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s domestic food and nutrition assistance programs affect the
  daily lives of millions of people, from almost half the infants born in the US to older adults, and they provide a
  nutrition safety net to ensure that no eligible American goes hungry. About one in four persons participate in at
  least one program at some point during a given year. Even more people rely on USDA guidance about what to eat for
  a nutritious diet—both individuals and organizations like hospitals, assisted living facilities, and childcare centers.
  This competition challenges data scientists to use machine learning and natural language processing to link databases
  on a large scale, helping millions of Americans make better food and nutrition choices while at the same time saving
  US taxpayers money."

- title: "Collaborative project to develop OSS that visualizes and analyzes research data from VIVO systems"
  image: LYRASIS_RDASH.svg
  description: "In this project we will create RDash, a web-based data-driven research intelligence platform for
  the analysis of the Texas A&M research enterprise. We envision this platform as one of the core components
  for an integrated and comprehensive Decision Support System (DSS) for research enterprises. Within the scope of
  this project, our team aims to: (1) Create a dashboard for interactive analysis of the Texas A&M research enterprise,
  (2) Identify existing Texas A&M research capacity for strategic assessment, (3) Identify Texas A&M subject matter experts
  and research clusters, (4) Advance opportunities for interdisciplinary research, (5) Strategically map capacity to
  state/national priorities, funding opportunities"
